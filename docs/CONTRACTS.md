# CONTRACTS — canonical wire protocols

This file is the **single source of truth** for cross-process wire contracts.
Both bridge mirrors (TS host + Python brain) build against THIS doc.
Changing a shape here is a deliberate, versioned act — not a side effect of a
code edit. If code and this doc disagree, **this doc wins** and the code is the
bug.

## 1. AetherCode ↔ Brain bridge event protocol  ·  `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 3`

The event seam between the headless brain (decides) and the TS host (renders +
executes). Full prose + rationale: [`BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md`](./BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md).

**Mirrors that MUST stay in lockstep with this version:**
- `aether_agent/protocol.py` (Unlimited-Context) — `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
- `src/core/brain_protocol.ts` (this repo) — `PROTOCOL_VERSION`

**Conformance fixture (the drift detector):** an identical
`bridge_conformance.json` lives in `test/fixtures/` (this repo) and
`tests/fixtures/` (Unlimited-Context). Each side's test suite loads its copy and
asserts its codec round-trips every message + that `protocol_version` matches the
constant. A failing conformance test = drift; fix the code or bump the version.

### Versioning rule

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` is the **MAJOR** (breaking) integer. Bump it (here + both
mirrors + both fixtures) only on a BREAKING change:
- removing/renaming a message `type` or field,
- changing a field's type or wire key, or making an optional field required.

**Additive, forward-compatible changes do NOT bump the integer** — a new message
`type`, or a new OPTIONAL field on an existing message, that old (v1) consumers
safely IGNORE. This is deliberate: downstream consumers gate on the integer, and
a bump falsely signals "breaking" to them. Additive changes are
instead recorded here + mirrored in both codecs + added to the fixture so the
conformance test covers them. (Receivers MUST already ignore unknown `type`s.)

History:
- **v2** — `turn` event + `done.remaining`/`done.reason` + `task.test_cmd` (the
  loop-fix / final-verification-gate patch). All additions are backward-tolerant
  (old consumers ignore the new event + optional fields); the integer was bumped
  to 2 alongside the schema rev so the conformance fixture stays in lockstep
  across both repos.
- **v3** — the `web_search`/`web_fetch` tools joined `TOOLS` (see Invariant 2).
  Separately, and never recorded here until now: the workflow swarm frames —
  `workflow_start`, `phase_start`, `phase_done`, `agent_spawn`,
  `agent_progress`, `agent_done`, `workflow_done` (the CODEPRO/HIGH+-effort
  multi-agent workflow view) — also landed in `brain_protocol.ts` during the
  v2->v3 window. Per the versioning rule above they're purely additive and
  didn't need their own bump; this doc's silence on them until now was a
  drift, not a deliberate omission, closed by this change per this doc's own
  rule ("if code and this doc disagree, this doc wins and the code is the
  bug"). Also additive, layered on top of the now-documented v3 baseline:
  `agent_done` gained optional `tokens`/`tool_calls`/`duration_ms` (Tier-2/3
  per-agent metrics for the terminal/desktop workflow panels —
  `docs/specs/2026-07-10-workflow-viewer-agent-panel-design.md`); absent on
  the wire, these decode to `undefined`, never a fabricated `0`.
- **Known gap:** `test/fixtures/bridge_conformance.json` (this repo) does not
  yet include any of the v3 workflow-swarm frames in its `events` array, so
  the conformance/drift-detector tests below don't exercise them. Extending
  the fixture requires an identical update to the Unlimited-Context mirror's
  copy (`tests/fixtures/bridge_conformance.json`, a separate repo) to avoid
  creating the exact cross-repo drift this fixture exists to prevent —
  flagged here, deliberately left for a coordinated cross-repo change rather
  than fixed unilaterally in this PR.

### Messages (wire = NDJSON, one JSON object per line, keys snake_case, ASCII-safe)

**brain → host (events)**

| type | fields | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `stage` | `name, face` | staged-lifecycle marker |
| `monologue` | `text, depth` | nested reasoning-tree line |
| `skill` | `name, reason` | a procedure packet was pinned |
| `turn` | `n, tool_calls, malformed, invented, no_call, fail_count` | per-assistant-turn diag (§8 emission curve) |
| `tool_call` | `id, name, args` | host must execute + reply with `tool_result` (same `id`) |
| `telemetry` | `tokens, tps, ctx_used, ctx_cap, vram` | live effort/velocity |
| `status` | `phase, pool_used, pool_cap` | drives the pool bar (`pool_cap = pool_gb × 233M`) |
| `checkpoint` | `git_sha` | a verified step was committed |
| `done` | `ok, result, remaining, reason` | run finished; `ok` from a real final test run (see invariant 5) |
| `error` | `msg` | run aborted |
| `workflow_start` | `workflow_id, phases[{n, type, agents}], total_agents` | a CODEPRO/HIGH+ multi-agent workflow began |
| `phase_start` | `phase_n, phase_type, agent_count` | a workflow phase began |
| `phase_done` | `phase_n, artifact_summary` | a workflow phase completed |
| `agent_spawn` | `agent_id, phase_n, brief` | one swarm agent started |
| `agent_progress` | `agent_id, delta` | streamed output from one swarm agent (emitter not confirmed on the shared backend — see `docs/specs/2026-07-10-workflow-viewer-agent-panel-design.md` Finding E) |
| `agent_done` | `agent_id, phase_n, summary, tokens?, tool_calls?, duration_ms?` | one swarm agent finished; the last 3 fields are optional Tier-2/3 metrics, absent on older brains |
| `workflow_done` | `synthesis, total_phases, total_agents` | the multi-agent workflow finished |

**host → brain (commands)**

| type | fields | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | `text, cwd, pool_gb, effort, model, test_cmd` | starts a run (first message). `test_cmd`="" → unverifiable run |
| `tool_result` | `id, output, exit_code` | reply to a `tool_call` (id MUST echo) |
| `control` | `action (pause\|resume\|steer), note` | interactive control |

### Invariants (enforced by tests)

1. **Tool-call correlation.** The brain emits ONE `tool_call` and blocks until
   the host replies, so replies are strictly ordered. A `tool_result` whose `id`
   does not match the outstanding call is a protocol violation → the brain emits
   `error` and aborts (it does NOT skip — skipping mis-pairs results to calls).
2. **One tool implementation, host-side.** `read_file · write_file · run_shell ·
   run_tests · repo_search · git_commit · web_search · web_fetch` (the full
   canonical `TOOLS` set, `src/core/brain_protocol.ts`; this row previously
   listed only the first 6 — pre-existing drift, closed by this change). A
   single path-guard canonicalizes (realpath: resolves `..`, absolute paths,
   and symlinks) BEFORE the workspace allowlist check for the filesystem/shell
   tools; `web_search`/`web_fetch` have no repo path to canonicalize and are
   guarded separately (SSRF/loopback/redirect checks, `src/core/web.ts`).
   Output is `[exit N]\n…`, capped, with stderr captured.
3. **Encoding is lossless, codec-boundary only.** The wire is ASCII-escaped
   (`ensure_ascii`) so it survives a Windows cp1252 pipe; decode restores exact
   UTF-8. Rendered frames are real UTF-8 — escaping never touches them.
4. **Cloud parity (honest gap).** Today's cloud SSE runs tools server-side and
   emits no `tool_call` frame, so `CloudBrain.sendToolResult` is a no-op. When
   the server adds `tool_call` frames + an upstream channel it implements the
   same round-trip — no host change. This is a known divergence, not silent.
5. **`done.ok` is ground-truth, never self-report.** The brain runs the test
   command one final time before `done` and derives `ok` from its exit code — an
   agent must never emit `ok:true` that contradicts its own last `run_tests`. A
   no-tool-call turn means "verify, then keep going or stall", NOT "success".
   `done.reason` ∈ {"", stalled, no-progress, max-turns, unverified}; the host
   manifest's `finalStatus` mirrors it (`ok` only on a verified green;
   `unverified` when `task.test_cmd`=""). `remaining` = failing tests when not ok.

## Other contracts

- **Aether Code private host protocol** (`aether.code.host/1`): canonical
  supervision, handshake, credential-boundary, and host-action contract is
  [`AETHER_CODE_HOST_PROTOCOL.md`](./AETHER_CODE_HOST_PROTOCOL.md). It explicitly
  reuses the unchanged `aether.exec/2` execution stream and
  `aether.exec.control/2` control stream.
- **Universal UVT stream** (chat/orchestrator/MCP SSE): owned by the Aether
  platform; surfaced here by `src/core/stream.ts`. The bridge's `CloudBrain` maps
  that vocabulary onto the event protocol above.
- **CLI auth** (device flow + `aek_` PAT): the CLI↔platform auth contract; see
  `src/core/device.ts`.
