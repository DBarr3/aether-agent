// receipts.ts — when the durable cursor is allowed to move.
//
// The host uploads a batch of observation events and the broker answers with
// receipts. Advancing the cursor means "these are safely stored, drop them
// locally". Getting that wrong in either direction is bad, but not equally bad:
//
//   advance too eagerly -> events are gone, and the viewer silently missed part
//                          of a session nobody can reconstruct
//   advance too late    -> events are re-sent and deduped broker-side by
//                          host_event_id
//
// The second is cheap and self-correcting. So every ambiguity resolves to
// "preserve the batch", and `validateReceipts` returns a REASON rather than a
// boolean, because the host has to be able to say honestly why it did not
// advance.
//
// FIVE THINGS A RECEIPT MUST PROVE, AND THE FOUR PR #108 CHECKED
//
// PR #108's `validatedReceiptSeqs` checked the batch was fully covered, had no
// duplicate ids, no rejected flag, and that each seq was a positive safe
// integer. Necessary, not sufficient. It would accept:
//
//   * receipts whose sequences run backwards within one batch,
//   * sequences at or below the cursor the host already durably recorded,
//   * a receipt for the right event id carrying a digest for different bytes.
//
// The first two let a broker — or something impersonating one — replay stale
// sequence numbers to make the host drop events it never really stored. The
// third is the event-id/payload binding the specification names
// RC_EVENT_ID_CONFLICT: the same id with different bytes is a different event,
// and accepting it would let a retry silently change what a viewer saw.
