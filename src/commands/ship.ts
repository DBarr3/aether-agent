// `aether ship` / `/ship` — publish the head branch, then open a pull request.
//
// core/ship.ts has held a safe PR-creation core since commit #86 and nothing
// called it: a `--repo` run ended with `prCreateHint`, a printed gh incantation
// the user had to retype. This is the command that calls it.
//
// The command layer owns three things and delegates everything else:
//
//  1. THE CONFIRMATION SCREEN. Publishing puts work under the user's name, so
//     what is about to run is shown as argv VECTORS — one element per line, in
//     full, never abbreviated. A `$ gh pr create --title "…"` one-liner is
//     wrong twice: it implies a shell parses it, and a long or multi-line body
//     has to be elided to fit. The user cannot approve what they were not shown.
//  2. THE AUTHORITY BOUNDARY. `--yes` exists so a scripted run does not hang on
//     a prompt; it must not become the way work gets published with nobody
//     having said so. Publishing needs the action NAMED: `--approve publish`.
//  3. A gh argv ALLOWLIST at the last moment before a process starts. A
//     blacklist of dangerous words has to anticipate the attack; an allowlist
//     has to anticipate the feature, so `pr merge`, `--admin`, `--auto` and
//     `--squash` fail simply by not being on it.
//
// Everything about what may be pushed, where, and whether it is a fast-forward
// lives in core/publish.ts. Nothing here re-derives it, and nothing here can
// force, merge, or push a ref other than HEAD's own branch.
